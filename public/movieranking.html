<h3> The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>This movie gives you moral lessons that you should keep trying and keep finding waysto rise.</p>

<h3>The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring</h3>
<p>Small character interactions and steps make up a greater epic story of good vs evil and friendship and companionship triumphing in the face of unbelievable odds.</p>

<p>Infinity War has a lot of plot to get through.</p> <br />
